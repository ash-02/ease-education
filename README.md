# Ease-Education

<h1>Introduction</h1>

##### Among the overall world population around 5% that is 466M people are suffering from hearing problems. Due to their hearing impairement they are not getting enough education and our education system is also not suitable for them to study. So we thought of making a new way which will be easier for them to learn tha basics or neccesary education which every citizen should get. Here we building a software, In which the teacher can teach in the normal way but the impaired student will be visually seeing in the monitor what the teaching saying in a pictorial manner. which helps the impaired student to understant the concepts easily as well as they can also learn with other normal students. So our main objective is to build an application which will translate the things which are said by the teacher or faculty to a easier way that can be understanded by the hearing impaired student. Here is some of the **feature** which we will be included in our project, **News Feeds** (shows you any important functions or any notices), **Messages and inbox** (this features gives the flexibility for different users to contact others), **Dynamic notes saver** (this gives the students a comfortable as well as ease way to gets the notes) and all other basic features like file transfer permission, security alert, etc. The only **constraint** known so far is if the student is visually impaired then he/she won't able to use this web application.
